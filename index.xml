Beyond the academic purpose, this article is motivated by a deep interest in studying the dynamics of society and its most influential factors. You can check the references for each fact for further research, or to assess the validity of my statements, which reflect my vision on the topic.

Longevity, the ability to reach an age above average, is influenced by intrinsic (genetic) and extrinsic factors (lifestyle, nutrition, mental and physical wellbeing). In this paper, the authors suggest there is a correlation between exercise and reduction in risks for cardiovascular diseases, various forms of cancer and decaying in muscles and the skeleton; moreover, such correlation may be proportional to the exercise volume (duration x intensity).</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://halixness.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Nov 2021 22:42:36 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://halixness.github.io/about/</guid><description>"A mind is a parachute, it doesn't work if you don't open it". E-mail Resumé Linkedin Github I graduated in Computer Science in 2021 at the University of Parma, Italy. I am junior software engineer and my current focus is Deep Learning: Self Supervised Learning Multi-modal learning Language models Reinforcement Learning I am also interested in life-long investing, longevity, sociology and visual arts.</description></item><item><title>deepSWE: video prediction applied on shallow water equations.</title><link>https://halixness.github.io/projects/deep-learning/deepswe/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://halixness.github.io/projects/deep-learning/deepswe/</guid><description>TL;DR: you can read the paper here (Italian) and check the repository.
Between late 2020 and summer 2021, I had the pleasure to work with Prof. Alessandro Dal Palú and the HyLab research team at the University of Parma. The subject for this thesis project is Shallow Water Equations and methods in deep learning to compute them with cost and time efficiency.
My proposal was an initial approach to video prediction models: the flooding scenario is discretized into a 2D grid with variable resolution.</description></item><item><title>Learning Transferable Visual Models From Natural Language Supervision</title><link>https://halixness.github.io/projects/deep-learning/clip-seminar/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://halixness.github.io/projects/deep-learning/clip-seminar/</guid><description>TL;DR: you can find the repository here.
In october 2021 I joined the seminar &amp;ldquo;Learning with Limited labeled data&amp;rdquo; at the University of Tuebingen. I decided to study and present the model &amp;ldquo;CLIP&amp;rdquo; and correlated: DALL-E, Big Sleep, CLIP GLaSS.
Briefly, in this paper a novel approach for natural language vision is proposed: in order to link text with images, captions and photos are encoded as vectors in the same embedding space, with contrastive learning the model learns to best match these vectors.</description></item><item><title>The EDGY - a software engineering project</title><link>https://halixness.github.io/projects/swe/comp-2913-the-edgy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://halixness.github.io/projects/swe/comp-2913-the-edgy/</guid><description>TL;DR: you can find the repository here.
